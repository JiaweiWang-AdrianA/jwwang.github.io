    content: "My research broadly spans **AI safety**, with a particular focus on **privacy issues in Machine Learning (ML) and AI**. I am especially interested in the following directions:"
    bulletpoints:
      - "**Privacy Auditing for Machine Learning**: Studying unintended memorization and information leakage in ML models, particularly through membership inference attacks (MIAs), and developing auditing methods to better evaluate privacy risks in practice."
      - "**Attacks and Defenses for Machine Unlearning**: Investigating how privacy and security risks evolve after unlearning, especially in tabular data models, including attacks that exploit incomplete forgetting as well as defenses that improve the effectiveness and reliability of unlearning algorithms."
      - "**Privacy-Preserving and Verifiable Federated Learning**: Designing federated learning frameworks that protect sensitive client data while providing verifiable guarantees on training integrity, robustness, and privacy preservation."
